# Kumquat

Small scale virtual hosting portal.

## Features

- Web VHost management (including support for SSL Certificates)
- MySQL Database management
- FTP Users
- No complicated reseller/permission system (single user model)
- Relatively agnostic to server software (built for SmartOS Zones with apache from pkgsrc, but support for nginx would be just one template change and a setting away)
- (optional) per VHost ZFS filesystem allows fine grained snapshots and backups
